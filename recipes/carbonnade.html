    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonnade Flamande is a traditional Belgian sweet-sour beef stew, similar to the French Beef Bourguignon but cooked with beer instead of red wine.</p>
    <p>It is seasoned with thyme, bay leaves and mustard and it is usually served with fries or bread and accompanied by a beer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds chuck roast, trimmed and cut into stew cubes</li>
        <li>4 slices of bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 11.2oz bottles of Flemish Sour Ale</li>
        <li>3 medium onions, sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>4 springs of fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whole grain mustard</li>
        <li>1 Cup chopped parsley plus more to garnish</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the beef with the beer, the garlic, the bay leaves and a pinch of salt for at least two hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Drain the beef and reserve the marinade. Pat dry the beef with paper towels.</li>
        <li>In a dutch oven, heat the olive oil until pipping hot. Fry the beef in batches, until golden brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove the beef cubes and reserve.</li>
        <li>In the same dutch oven, fry the bacon until golden and crisp. Reserve with the beef.</li>
        <li>Add the onions, a pinch of salt and fry in the bacon grease, until caramelized (around 10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the flour and cook for about 2 minutes until the flour is cooked and the onions are coated.</li>
        <li>Add the beef broth and scrape the bits stuck in the bottom. Add the reserved marinade, the beef, the bacon and the thyme.</li>
        <li>Cook for 1.5 hours.</li>
        <li>Add the brown sugar, the parsley, some fresh pepper and the mustard. Cook for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some fresh parsley on top and serve with fries.</li>
    </ol>
